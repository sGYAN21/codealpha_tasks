=== Space Invaders X ===

Space Invaders X was programmed on and off in my spare time while studying
Software Engineering at the University of Auckland. Work began in June 2005 and
it was finally completed in November 2007. It was created as an entry to a game
creation competition organised by one Andrew "MANdrew" W to create a
Space Invaders Game in Java, particularly aimed at the Software Engineering
class of 2004-2007, who were half way through their second year at the time of
the competition. Due to lack of entrants all official competition end dates
were ignored and progress on Space Invaders X continued from time to time for
the next two and a half years.

In November 2016 I ported Space Invaders X to use PlayN, which involved only
minor changes, so that I could then cross-compile it to use HTML5 / WebGL.

To create Space Invaders X I used:
* Sun Java 1.5.0
* PlayN
* TextPad
* Mozilla Firefox
* Adobe Photoshop 6.0
* WaveSurfer
* MS Paint, Sound Recorder, Calculator

This game is dedicated to the Software Engineering class of 2004-2007 at the 
University of Auckland.

=== Notes ===

Instead of clicking the START button, you can start the game by clicking a
hidden "TRAIN" button at the start of the screen, which starts the game in
training mode. This means you have infinite lives, but your score will not be
shown on the highscore table.

The same number of enemies appear in one or two player mode so the game is
much easier with two players.

=== Ownership ===

The code is my own except where it uses the underlying platform -
originally the Java SDK, and now also PlayN.

The graphics are mostly borrowed but are usually modified and occasionally
created from scratch.
The sounds are all borrowed but a few have been modified.
The music is entirely borrowed (see music/credits.txt).
